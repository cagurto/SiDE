Child mode patch for RADMC-3D version 0.41 and earlier
------------------------------------------------------

In RADMC-3D version 0.41 and earlier the number of photons used in the thermal 
Monte Carlo radiative transfer was not configurable in child mode by piping 
commands to the code.

To fix this issue, overwrite main.f90 file in $RADMC3D_PATH/src folder by 
main_patch.f90 file and execute the following command:

```bash
make clean ; make ; make install
```

Note: the issue is resolved in the development version of RADMC-3D. As of 
      26.06.2019 no new stable release containing the patch was issued.
